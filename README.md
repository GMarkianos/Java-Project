# Java-Project
This is an object oriented assignment on Java.

This is a project I completed a year ago with one friend for our university programming semester assignment.The goal of the assignment was to test our skills in object oriented programming. The assignment was to create an environment for tenants and landlords to interact with eachother to rent and review properties. It supports login authentication as each user has his own account.

Tenant username: user1
Tenant password: password1

Landlord username: provider1
Landlord password: password1
