This project was a semester assignment in our University(Aristotele University of Thessaloniki) assigned to teams of two. It tested our object oriented programming skills 
on Java as we created an Airbnb-like aplication for tenatnts to rent and review accomodations and providers to upload their accomodations accompanied by their general
data(location , street name , type , etc.) as well as their extra facilities (seaside view , AC , etc.). It supports login authetication as each user has their own account.
Below there are the credentials for two accounts(one tenant account and one provider account) for anyone who might want to test and use the aplication.

Tenant username: user1
Tenant password: password1

Provider username: provider1
Provider password: password1
